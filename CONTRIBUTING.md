Feature requests are welcome.  
If the idea is large or breaking, please open an issue first to discuss design and scope.

## Commercial Support vs Open Source

This project offers optional commercial support for businesses.

This does **not** affect:
- Which features are accepted
- How pull requests are reviewed
- How community issues are handled

Contributions are always evaluated on technical merit, usefulness, and alignment with the project's goals — not whether someone is a paying customer.

## Code of Conduct

Be kind and professional. Harassment, hostility, and discrimination are not tolerated.

If you experience issues, please open an issue or contact the maintainer privately.
